# ATmopheric Model One-dimentional (ATMO)

### 1. Introduction

**ATMO** is a one-dimensional model used to calculate concentrations of chemical species over the atmosphere. 
Compared to the ATMO\_KPP version, this version allows users to freely adjust reaction equations by providing 
a properly formatted reaction file.

### 2. Features

Similar to ATMO\_KPP, this version also offers built-in format conversion and plotting functions. Unlike ATMO\_KPP, 
this version uses a box model developed by Zackary Moon to replace code generated by KPP. This allows the program 
to automatically recognize user-defined reaction functions and calculate concentrations of species based on them. 
Like ATMO\_KPP, this version also includes all functions required to calculate the environmental setting.

### 3. Installation & Usage

ATMO requires the following packages

    python3-tk
    numpy
    scipy
    netcdf4
    pandas
    xarray
    matplotlib

Once all packages are installed, download all code and run GUI.py

### 4. Limitations

This program is still under construction. Limitations include:

1. Currently, **this program does NOT support photolysis reactions**.
2. Depending on the reaction functions used, this program will generate species that are chemically incorrect.
3. Each specie configuration file is unique to the selected equation files. Users cannot use specie configuration file generated for one set of equations for another set of equations.
4. Specie unit can only be ppbv or molec\_cm3.
5. The reaction functions must be formatted correctly. The requirements are:
    1. For any rate expression that involves calculation, there must be a space before and after a function call.  
    2. There cannot be any space between arguments for a function.  
    3. For numeric operands (including numeric variables), there could be any number of spaces between them and operators.  
    4. The first character in expression cannot be a parenthese. 
 
 Examples of correctly formatted rate expressions:

        0.21* ARR2(3.30e-11,-55,TEMP) +0.78* ARR2(2.15e-11,-110,TEMP)
        1.44e-13\*(1+(C\_M/4.2e+19))
        k37(TEMP,C\_M,C\_H2O)
        7.2e-34 \*0.78084\* C\_M\*0.20946\*C\_M * (TEMP / 300)\*\*(-2.6)

 Examples of incorrectly formatted rate expressions:

        (0.21\*ARR2( 3.30e-11,-55.0,TEMP) + 0.78\*ARR2(2.15e-11,-110,TEMP))
        k37( TEMP, C\_M, C\_H2O )

6. Currently, this program only has the following functions built in:

        ARR
        ARR2
        TROE
        TROEE
        k46
        k37
        THERMAL\_T2
